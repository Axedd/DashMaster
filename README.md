# üöÄ 30-Day C# and .NET Mastery Challenge

Welcome to my 30-day journey to mastering C# and .NET! Over the course of this month, I have dived deep into C#, .NET, and WPF to develop a solid foundation in these technologies. This challenge has culminated in a final project: a WPF Dashboard application that manages executable files for video games and other services, integrates with a Weather API, and monitors Twitch streamers' live status.

  - Layouts (Grid, StackPanel, etc.)

- **Days 11-14: Data Binding and Commands**
  - Data binding (one-way, two-way)
  - Using commands (ICommand interface)
  - ObservableCollection and INotifyPropertyChanged

### **Week 3: Intermediate WPF and Project Work**
- **Days 15-18: Intermediate WPF Features**
  - Styles and templates
  - Resources (static and dynamic)

  - Dependency properties and attached properties
  - Custom controls
  - Animations and visual states

- **Days 26-30: Final Project**
  - Develop a comprehensive WPF application
  - Implement advanced features and best practices
  - Deploy and document the project

## üõ†Ô∏è Final Project: WPF Dashboard Application

### üéØ **Project Goals:**
- **Executable Management:** Manage and launch various executable files for video games and other services.
- **Weather API Integration:** Display real-time weather data using a weather API.
- **Twitch Integration:** Monitor Twitch streamers' live status and notify the user when they go live.

### üí° **Features:**

- **Dashboard Layout:** 
  - A clean, intuitive interface designed using WPF controls and layouts. 
  - Provides easy navigation and a well-organized view of all functionalities.

- **File Management:**
  - Add, remove, and launch executable files directly from the dashboard. 
  - **Note:** Removal of individual executables is still under development. ‚úÖ 

- **Weather Updates:**
  - Integration with a Weather API to provide real-time weather information for a selected location. 
  - Displays current weather conditions prominently on the dashboard.

- **Twitch Live Notifications:**
  - Track favorite Twitch streamers and receive notifications when they go live. 
  - **Note:** Notification reception is still under development. ‚ùå

- **Custom Controls:**
  - Utilize custom WPF controls to enhance the user experience. 
  - **Note:** Custom controls are currently under development and will be added in future updates. ‚ùå

- **Data Binding:**
  - Implement data binding for dynamic UI updates. 
  - Ensures that changes in data are automatically reflected in the user interface.

- **Dependency Injection:**
  - Use Dependency Injection (DI) to manage services and ensure a scalable architecture. 
  - Promotes a modular, testable, and maintainable codebase.

### üåê **Technologies Used:**
- **C# and .NET Core:** Core programming and backend logic.
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation):** For building the user interface.
- **Entity Framework Core:** For managing data and interacting with the MySQL database.
- **Mapbox:** For integrating weather data and location-based features in the application.
- **Twitch API:** To track streamers' live status.
